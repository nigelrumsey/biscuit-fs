# Hello

Updated for new branch

Welcome to Broken Biscuits.

I'm interested in journalism, photojournalism, architecture, art and cinema. I've been looking for somewhere to write about some of these things. The site is new as of April 2025, so there may not be much to see here yet.

For some time, I've been self-studying Documentary Photography, more recently concentrating on Conflict Photography and its representation in the media. Currently, there's no end point. I'm interested in the future of news and photojournalism and this sits beautifully in the intersection of that Venn diagram.

I'd also like to share a little about some difficulty I'm having with the antidepressants I take for anxiety and depression, currently that is Amitriptyline and Fluoxetine (Prozac) â€“ [[My Head Hurts 1]].

None of the posts here are necessarily 'finished'. Think of it more as my thoughts at the time of writing. I aim to revisit and update them often.

This site is made and published with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I'm new to it, but enjoying feeling my way so far.

This site **does not** collect visitor data, store cookies, analytics, or host ads. If you don't say 'Hi' I'll never know you were here.
